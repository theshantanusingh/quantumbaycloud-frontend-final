        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2025, QuantumBayCloud was born from a simple idea: businesses deserve secure, reliable, and affordable cloud storage solutions without compromising on privacy or performance.</p>
        <p>We recognized that small and medium-sized businesses needed enterprise-grade security and features without the enterprise price tag. That's why we built QuantumBayCloud—a platform that combines military-grade encryption, intuitive design, and transparent pricing.</p>
        <p>Today, we're proud to serve businesses across India and around the world, helping them secure their data, collaborate efficiently, and grow without limits.</p>
